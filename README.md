> **Note:** PDF-Extract-Kit is designed for high-quality document processing and functions as a model toolbox.    
> If you are interested in extracting high-quality document content (e.g., converting PDFs to Markdown), please use [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU), which combines the high-quality predictions from PDF-Extract-Kit with specialized engineering optimizations for more convenient and efficient content extraction.    
> If you're a developer looking to create engaging applications such as document translation, document Q&A, or document assistants, you'll find it very convenient to build your own projects using PDF-Extract-Kit. In particular, we will periodically update the PDF-Extract-Kit/project directory with interesting applications, so stay tuned!
